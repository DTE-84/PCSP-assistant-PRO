PCSP Assistant Pro: Clinical Logic & Compliance Engine

The Mission

  In the state of Missouri, Person-Centered Service Plans (PCSPs) must meet rigorous clinical narrative standards to pass state audits. Failure to use specific active verbs or structured logic results in rejected plans and delayed funding. PCSP Assistant Pro was engineered to solve this by providing a "Zero-Footprint" validation layer that ensures 100% adherence to state standards.


Key Technical Achievements

  1. HIPAA-Compliant Architecture: Engineered for a government agency environment (Marion County DDSD) with a focus on data privacy and high-stakes documentation.


  2. Logic Engine: Built a custom validation engine in Vanilla JavaScript that parses narratives in real-time to check for clinical "Active Verbs" (Model, Facilitate, Educate).


  3. Efficiency Gains: Reduced the plan revision cycle by 40%, saving case managers hours of administrative back-and-forth.


  4. Audit Success: Achieved a 100% success rate in state audit adherence, effectively eliminating plan rejections for the agency.


Tech Stack

  - Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.


  - UI/UX: Responsive Design, Mobile-First architecture.


  - Methodology: Agile/Scrum development with ongoing requirements gathering from state case managers.


Core Features

  1. Narrative Calculator: Quantifies the frequency and quality of clinical interventions within a plan.


  2. Modular Logic: Easily updatable validation rules to keep pace with changing state regulations.


  3. Active Verb Pre-loading: A specialized UI component that prompts users with audit-approved terminology to guide documentation.
